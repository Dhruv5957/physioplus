        Q.1 Who is a right Physiotheraphy for me?
        <hr>
        <span
          >Physioplus helps find the right physio depending on the condition of
          the patient and the type of treatment the patient has to go through.
          Suppose there is a case of post-surgery, so this patient will be
          assigned an ortho physiotherapist, and in some critical cases, like a
          patient with post-stroke, Physioplus will make sure that he gets an
          experienced physiotherapist. Let us explain with one more example:
          Suppose there is a sports player who is suffering from any physical
          pain or injury, so he will be assigned to a specialist sports physio.
          In some cases, the patient is not aware of what exactly he is facing,
          whether it is a muscle spasm or muscle strain, so in that case,
          physioplus takes an assessment in which he gets to know the approach
          of treatment.

        Q.2 What procedures are used in physiotherapy?
        <hr>
        <span>
          The assessment of the patient is done by a physio where they set a
          track for the process of the treatment. There are different approaches
          used in physiotherapy treatments, but they may vary from patient to
          patient depending upon the condition of the patient and the type of
          treatment needed. The common procedure includes the following: Manual
          Exercises Soft Tissue Mobilization -Electrotherapy-Heat Therapy
          -Taping for sports injuries - Ultrasound

        Q.3 How is sports physiotherapy different from physiotherapy?
        <hr>
        <span>
          Improving sports player performance requires a deeper understanding of
          your body as a working system, and it’s this understanding that moves
          us way beyond simply reducing pain and into the realms of holistic
          treatment and long-term results. Physioplus sports physio starts by
          defining your goals and then moves on to understanding your pain or
          limitation, treating the cause (or causes, as there’s often more than
          one) and, crucially, staying with you on the journey to ensure lasting
          benefits. Physioplus sports physio even determines at an early stage
          that your shoulder injury, for example, needs investigation by another
          health professional before we can begin treatment. Or we might pick up
          in our early assessment that nerve irritation is causing muscle
          weakness and affecting your technique, which if undetected, would make
          a strength training programme a very ineffective treatment.

        Q.4 Do I get relief from pain by performing the RICE
        (REST-ICE-COMPRESS-ELEVATION) procedure?
        <hr>
        <span>
        Yes, you will surely get relief
        but not be able to treat the source of your pain. To cure the source of
        pain, you need to consult a specialised physiotherapist to restore
        proper mobility by performing the right exercise routines prescribed by
        physio. And Physioplus helps you to find the best physio in town.

        Q.5 How Physio is assigned by Physioplus? 
        <hr>
        <span>
        Physioplus has a network of  experienced physiotherapists available in multiple areas. Along with the
        patient's condition and treatment requirements, we ask for your location
        as well. We determine the best fit for your treatment based on a
        combination of these two factors. Other factors include gender
        preference; i.e., female physios are assigned for treatment of female
        patients unless the patient gives consent for a male physio. Also, we
        prefer to send a nearby available physiotherapist so that for long-term
        treatments, sessions don’t get skipped and on-time treatment will be
        given to the patient. Physioplus makes sure that the patient gets the
        right physio who can treat his issues very well.
